Practicing my HTML / CSS.

I pretty much just copied the stylesheets I found from google and tried to get divs to work with me. I have no idea how to make search bars look like google did. But for a first try, this wasn't too bad.
I am certain there are WAY too many style rules (as I copied all of them), but at least I got things somewhat in working order by referencing the class and div names and doing things.
